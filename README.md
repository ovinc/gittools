Tools for using GIT in python, based on *gitpython*.

Functions
---------

The module is designed to use mainly the two following function:

---

```python
current_commit_hash(path=None, checkdirty=True, checktree=True)
```

Return HEAD commit hash corresponding to path if it's in a GIT repo.

**Input**
- path: str or path object of folder or file. If None (default), it is
considered to be the current working directory.
- checkdirty: bool, if True exception raised if repo has uncommitted changes.
- checktree: bool, if True exception raised if path/file not in repo's
working tree and path is not the root directory of the repo.

**Output**
- str of the commit's hash name.

---

```python
module_git_status(module, warning=False)
```

Get current commit hashes and status (dirty or clean) of list of modules.

**Input**

- module or list/iterable of modules (each must belong to a git repository)
- warning: if True, prints a warning if some git repos are dirty.

**Output**

- Dictionary with module name as keys, and a dict {hash:, status:} as values

---

The following function is coded to be used by *current_commit_hash* but is also made available in case it proves useful in some situations.

`path_in_tree(path, commit)`

Return True if path belongs to the commit's working tree, else False.

Note that if the path is the root directory of the git repository (where
the .git is located), the function also returns True even if one could
argue that the root directory is technically not in the repo's tree.

**Inputs**
- path: str or path object of folder or file
- commit: *gitpython* commit object

---


Examples
--------

In all examples below, `h` is a string containing the 40-digit hexadecimal commit ID (hash name). Before running the examples, the module needs to be imported with
```python
from gittools import current_commit_hash
```

---

Find the most recent commit ID of the **current working directory**
```python
h = current_commit_hash()
```

---

If the repository has **uncommited changes**, use the `checkdirty` option to avoid raising an exception:
```python
h = current_commit_hash(checkdirty=False)
```

---

Find the most recent commit ID of a **specific file**, e.g. *Test/foo.py*
```python
h = current_commit_hash('Test/foo.py')
```

---

Note that the previous example will raise an exception if the **file is not tracked** in a git repository. To silence the exception and see the most recent commit ID of the closest git repository in a parent directory, use the `checktree` option:
```python
h = current_commit_hash('Test/untracked_file.pyc', checktree=False)
```

---

Find the commit ID of a **python package** *mypackage* that is in a git repository:
```python
import mypackage
h = current_commit_hash(mypackage.__file__)
```

or use the higher level to get hash and clean/dirty status in form of a dictionary of a module or list of modules:
```python
import mypackage1, mypackage2
info1 = module_git_status(mypackage1)
info2 = module_git_status(mypackage2, warning=True)  # warning if dirty repo
infos = module_git_status([mypackage1, mypackage2])
```

---

Install
-------

### Method 1

In a terminal:
```bash
pip install git+https://cameleon.univ-lyon1.fr/ovincent/gittools
```

### Method 2

Clone the project or download directly the files into a folder.
In a terminal, cd into the project or folder, where the setup.py is, then

```bash
pip install .
```

- Clone the project or download directly the files into a folder.
- In a terminal, `cd` into the project's folder (where the file
__setup.py__ is located).
- run `python -m pip install .` in the command line.

Now, the module can be imported in Python with `import gittools`.

**Note**: replace `python` with the command or alias corresponding to the Python installation you would like to install the package with.

**Note**: if you wish to keep the package files in the folder where the files
were downloaded and/or edit the files with direct effect in Python, run the
following install command instead: `python -m pip install -e .`.


Requirements
------------

- Python >= 3.6 (f-strings)
- gitpython (https://gitpython.readthedocs.io)
- see gitpython requirements for GIT minimal version.
